Responds with:

JSON describing all the available endpoints on your API, see the endpoints.json for an (incomplete) example that you could build on, or create your own from scratch!

You will eventually write a README for your project to detail what your project is and how to get access to it. This /api endpoint however will effectively act as documentation detailing all the available endpoints and how they should be interacted with.

Each endpoint should detail

What queries are accepted?

What format does the request body need to adhere to?

What does an example response look like?

You will be expected to test for this endpoint responding with an accurate JSON object. You will also be expected to update this JSON object for every endpoint you complete! This will be very helpful to your future self when it comes to using your api in the Front End block of the course!
